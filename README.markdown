#Â NGTS Prototype Status

This app documents the nightly quality plots for the Geneva prototype

## Structure

The main class will be the `observation` class, which contains the information about a single observation, as this is the unit of work chosen by the consortium. This observation will have a series of measurements, but it also belongs to a night object, if the dates of said observation are required.
